# About

GameAsset.org was created by Josh Moody, a college student and amateur game developer who despises U.S. copyright law.

Copyright law is overpowered and it sucks. I could write a book about how awful it is but [somebody already did that.](https://lessig.org/product/free-culture/) So, instead of listening to me rant about it, check out the e-book "Free Culture" by Lawrence Lessig.

(fittingly, the book is licensed under Creative Commons)

In my experience making games on a zero-dollar budget, public domain assets are the gold standard. They cost nothing and don't come with any pesky attribution licenses.

However, finding them is a frustrating process. You have to go to the third page of search results, visit a site that looks like it was designed in the early 90's, hunt around for the tiny download link, wait 30 seconds for the ad to stop playing, and then **sigh** it's a `.rar` file. So you download a third-party file extractor, sic it on that sketchy .rar file, spend 30 minutes sifting through all the extra junk files that got packed into the download, and maybe, just *maybe* you find that 3D model you were looking for. If you're lucky.

In an ideal world, there would be a easy-to-use platform where game devs could go to find public domain game assets, or dedicate their own assets to the public domain. That's why I created this site.

I'm not trying to make a profit. I'm just doing what I can to enrich the public domain and help out my fellow game devs. Love y'all <3
