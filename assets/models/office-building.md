A 3d model of a bank/office building that was originally intended for use in a heist game. Sadly, the game was later abandoned. But now you can use this office building for anything you want!

The topology isn't great, and the interior is barebones. So I'd recommend using it mainly for exterior scenes unless you modify it.
